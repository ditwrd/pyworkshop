## How to use Pyworkshop

If you love reading blog or medium post, you are going for a treat, you can click on the button above to access the website. There are a few bite size chapter that can help you to start your journey learning Python. This is in no way a thorough or a deep dive in anything about Python, but I hope this can help you to have an early understanding about Python.

## Backstory

This learning module development started when I was invited to do a workshop held by [Engineer Connect](https://www.linkedin.com/company/engineerconnect/) - a project made by one of my [friend](https://www.linkedin.com/in/najlaharza/). This project is in collaboration with [PT. Jokeen Solusi Teknologi (Jokeen.id)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jokeen-id/) where I do my freelance project.
